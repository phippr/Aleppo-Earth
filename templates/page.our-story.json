My journey began after the COVID vaccination when my skin suddenly became hypersensitive, plagued by hives, eczema, and rashes. Frustrated with steroid creams that only thinned my skin, I felt desperate for relief. Then, a friend gifted me an all-natural Aleppo soap from France. Skeptical but hopeful, I tried it—and within days, my skin felt calmer, less itchy, and the redness faded. By the month’s end, my dependence on steroids had nearly vanished. Inspired, I researched Aleppo soap, learning how its simple, natural ingredients nourish all skin types, from babies to those with dermatitis or psoriasis.Now, two years later, we’re dedicated to bringing this amazing soap to others in Australia. At Adira Earth, we’re passionate about helping people find gentle, effective alternatives to soothe their skin.                                          Thank you for joining us on this journey toward healthier, natural skincare!",
